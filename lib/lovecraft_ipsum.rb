    "The horrible conclusion which had been gradually intruding itself upon my confused and reluctant mind was 
    now an awful certainty. I was lost, completely, hopelessly lost in the vast and labyrinthine recess of the 
    Mammoth Cave. Turn as I might, in no direction could my straining vision seize on any object capable of serving 
    as a guidepost to set me on the outward path. That nevermore should I behold the blessed light of day, or scan 
    the pleasant bills and dales of the beautiful world outside, my reason could no longer entertain the slightest 
    unbelief. Hope had departed. Yet, indoctrinated as I was by a life of philosophical study, I derived no small 
    measure of satisfaction from my unimpassioned demeanour; for although I had frequently read of the wild frenzies 
    into which were thrown the victims of similar situations, I experienced none of these, but stood quiet as soon 
    as I clearly realised the loss of my bearings."
